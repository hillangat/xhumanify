### **Step 1: Add Account Deletion to Settings**

The account deletion interface is integrated into your existing `SettingsPage.tsx`:

```typescript
// Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Delete Account
```

### **Step 2: Confirm Account Deletion**

Users must complete a multi-step confirmation:

1. **Warning Display**: Shows what data will be deleted
2. **Type Confirmation**: User must type "DELETE" to confirm
3. **Agreement Checkbox**: Acknowledge that deletion is permanent
4. **Final Confirmation**: Click "Delete Account" button

### **Step 3: Account Deletion Process**

The deletion process includes these steps:

1. **Cancel Subscriptions**: Automatically cancels active Stripe subscriptions
2. **Delete Content History**: Removes all user content and history
3. **Remove Feedback**: Deletes user feedback and ratings
4. **Clear Local Data**: Removes localStorage, sessionStorage, and cache
5. **Additional Cleanup**: Placeholder for custom cleanup logic
6. **Validate Deletion**: Ensures deletion process completed successfully
7. **Remove Cognito Account**: Permanently deletes the user from AWS Cognito

## üîê **Security Features**

### **Authorization**
- Users can only delete their own accounts
- JWT token validation on backend calls
- Cognito identity verification

### **Confirmation Process**
- Multiple confirmation steps prevent accidental deletion
- Clear warnings about data loss
- Reversible process until final confirmation

### **Data Privacy**
- Complete data removal from all systems
- Stripe customer data cleanup
- Local storage and cache clearing

## üìä **Data Models Affected**

The following data models are cleaned up during account deletion:

- `UserContentHistory` - Content processing history
- `UserFeedback` - User feedback and ratings
- `UserSubscription` - Subscription information
- `UserSettings` - User preferences and settings
- Local browser storage and cache

## üé® **User Experience**

### **Visual Design**
- Professional warning interface with danger styling
- Progress indicators show real-time deletion status
- Mobile-responsive design for all devices
- Theme-aware styling (light/dark mode support)

### **Confirmation Flow**
- Clear information about what will be deleted
- Step-by-step guidance through the process
- Real-time feedback during deletion

## üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Options**

### **Stripe Integration**
Update the Stripe endpoint in `AccountDeletion.tsx`:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/cancel-subscription', {
  // Your Stripe webhook endpoint
});
```

### **Custom Data Models**
To include additional data models in cleanup:

1. Add model deletion calls in `executeAccountDeletion()` method
2. Update progress steps array to reflect new cleanup tasks
3. Add error handling for each new model type

### **Backend Cleanup**
For server-side bulk cleanup, implement the account cleanup Lambda function:
```typescript
// Use the provided account-cleanup function
// Customize table names and cleanup logic as needed
```

## üîß **Testing Considerations**

### **Test Account Deletion**
- Use test Stripe subscriptions
- Test with various user data scenarios
- Verify complete data removal
- Test error handling paths

### **Rollback Testing**
- Ensure cancellation works at each step
- Test network failure scenarios
- Verify partial deletion recovery

## üì± **Mobile Considerations**

- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly confirmation buttons
- Appropriate dialog sizing for mobile screens
- Accessible navigation and interaction

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Data Recovery**
- **Account deletion is permanent and irreversible**
- Users should export any needed data before deletion
- Consider implementing a "soft delete" with recovery period if needed

### **Compliance**
- Meets GDPR "right to be forgotten" requirements
- Provides clear data deletion confirmation
- Maintains audit logs of deletion requests (recommended)

### **Production Deployment**
1. Test thoroughly in development environment
2. Verify Stripe webhook endpoints are configured
3. Ensure DynamoDB permissions are correct
4. Test account deletion flow with real users
5. Monitor deletion success rates and errors

## üîó **Integration Points**

- **AWS Cognito**: User pool management
